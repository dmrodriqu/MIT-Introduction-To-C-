# MIT Introduction to C++



# Taken from the course description: 

This is a fast-paced introductory course to the C++ programming language. It is intended for those with little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn C++-specific constructs and concepts.

This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.


# Taken from the Syllabus:

Lectures: 3 sessions / week for 4 weeks, 1 hour / session

Labs: 1 session / week for 4 weeks, 3 hours / session

Course Objectives
This is a fast-paced introductory course to the C++ programming language. It is intended for those with little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn C++-specific constructs and concepts.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

Understand and use the basic programming constructs of C/C++

Manipulate various C/C++ datatypes, such as arrays, strings, and pointers

Isolate and fix common errors in C++ programs

Use memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures

Apply object-oriented approaches to software problems in C++

Write small-scale C++ programs using the above skills
